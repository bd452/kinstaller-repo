# Kindle Substrate Architecture

This repository now carries the first buildable Kindle Substrate implementation:
the runtime engine ABI, bootstrap, daemon, device CLI, demo target, sample tweak,
and host toolchain. It also remains the KPM distribution surface for the runtime
packages.

```

The Rust workspace keeps buildable source in the repo, while the KPM package
tree exposes only the device-facing artifacts Kinstaller needs.

## Published Packages

### `com.bd452.ksubstrate`

Library/control package. It owns the on-device session runtime and public tweak
ABI.

```text
package/
  manifest.json
  install.sh
  uninstall.sh
  app.sh
  launch.sh
  lib/
    kindlehf/
      libksubstrate.so
      libksubstrate-bootstrap.so
    kindlepw2/
      libksubstrate.so
      libksubstrate-bootstrap.so
  bin/
    kindlehf/
      ksubstrated
      ksubstrate
    kindlepw2/
      ksubstrated
      ksubstrate
  include/
    ksubstrate.h
  tweaks/
```

`install.sh` creates Documents launchers for enabling and disabling the session.
`app.sh` is the stable package-local control entry point:

```text
app.sh enable    # start ksubstrated, install session wrappers, restart UI
app.sh disable   # remove wrappers, restart stock UI, exit daemon
app.sh status    # report daemon/session state
app.sh toggle    # default for KPM launch
```

The package is built by `scripts/build-repo.sh`. Its local `build.sh`
cross-compiles the runtime crates for `kindlehf` and `kindlepw2`, stages the
artifacts, and then uses the repository's normal `scripts/pack-app.sh` path.

### `com.bd452.ksubstratedemo`

Demo package. It depends on `com.bd452.ksubstrate` and proves the loading path
without touching Kindle framework processes.

```text
package/
  manifest.json
  install.sh
  uninstall.sh
  app.sh
  launch.sh
  bin/
    kindlehf/ksubstrate-demo-target
    kindlepw2/ksubstrate-demo-target
  tweaks/
    com.bd452.ksubstratedemo/
      tweak.so
      tweak.ksfilter
      manifest.json
```

The target binary exports a `compute` symbol that returns an unhooked value and
calls it through a runtime-resolved pointer. The package launches the target
through the installed `ksubstrate` CLI, which preloads the bootstrap; the
bootstrap `dlopen`s the sample tweak, and the tweak installs a **real inline
hook** on `compute` via `kh_hook_function` before `main` runs. The target then
prints and writes the hooked value. This exercises the actual hooking engine
(not a cooperative dispatch table) while staying self-contained and recoverable.

Because `/proc/<pid>/comm` is truncated to 15 bytes, the bootstrap matches a
filter token against the truncated comm as well as the full name, so a filter
naming `ksubstrate-demo-target` matches the process seen as `ksubstrate-demo`.

## Runtime Model

Kindle Substrate is session-scoped. A hard reboot always returns to stock
behavior because the daemon lifetime is the hooked session.

```text
CLEAN boot
  user opens Enable Tweaks launcher
  ksubstrated starts
  daemon installs session wrappers for spawn roots
  daemon soft-restarts the framework to the home UI
  wrapped processes exec with LD_PRELOAD=libksubstrate-bootstrap.so
  bootstrap matches .ksfilter files and dlopens tweaks
HOOKED session
  user opens Disable Tweaks launcher, daemon crash guard trips, or device reboots
  daemon removes wrappers and restarts framework stock
CLEAN again
```

Design invariants:

- Hard reboot is a clean boot.
- Daemon lifetime is the session; no persistent session flag files.
- Enable means restart the UI into a known home-screen state, not live PID
  injection. Both the `enable` launcher and the default KPM launch (`toggle`)
  install session wrappers; `KSUBSTRATE_SYSTEM_WRAP=0` enables the daemon
  without touching framework processes for a safe smoke test.
- Hooks are installed at process exec by `LD_PRELOAD`, not by global
  `/etc/ld.so.preload`.
- Default spawn roots are Kindle UI roots such as `pillow`, `appmgrd`, and the
  home booklet host. Tweak filters can add firmware-resolved roots.
- `powerd`, `sshd`, `dbus`, OTA, storage, and networking core remain blacklisted
  from default wrapping.

## Device Filesystem Contract

The runtime package should treat its KPM package directory as the anchor:

```text
/mnt/us/kmc/kpm/packages/com.bd452.ksubstrate/
  app.sh
  bin/<platform>/ksubstrated
  bin/<platform>/ksubstrate
  lib/<platform>/libksubstrate.so
  lib/<platform>/libksubstrate-bootstrap.so
  include/ksubstrate.h
  tweaks/                 # live tweaks (daemon + bootstrap scan here / /var/local/kmc/tweaks)
  diagnostics/            # opt-in tools (e.g. inheritance probe); not auto-loaded
```

Session state lives under a daemon-owned volatile location, for example:

```text
/var/local/kmc/ksubstrate/
  run/
    ksubstrated.pid     # monitor pid
    disable             # disable marker observed by the monitor loop
    wrappers.list       # exact set of wrapped roots, used to restore on cleanup
    starts.log          # crash-loop guard start timestamps
    session.env         # resolved session summary
  log/
    ksubstrated.log     # daemon log
    tweaks.log          # engine/tweak log (wrappers set KSUBSTRATE_LOG here)
```

Installed tweaks live under the runtime package so they can be discovered by the
bootstrap and packaged by KPM:

```text
/mnt/us/kmc/kpm/packages/com.bd452.ksubstrate/tweaks/<tweak-id>/
  tweak.so
  tweak.ksfilter
  manifest.json
```

The emergency USB sentinel is:

```text
/mnt/us/DISABLE_KSUBSTRATE
```

The bootstrap checks it first and no-ops if present.

## Runtime Components

`libksubstrate.so` exposes the C ABI used by tweaks:

```c
int kh_hook_function(void *target, void *replacement, void **original);
int kh_hook_function_checked(
    void *target,
    void *replacement,
    void **original,
    const void *expected_prologue,
    size_t expected_len
);
int kh_unhook_function(void *target);
int kh_hook_import(const char *image, const char *symbol, void *replacement, void **original);
void *kh_find_symbol(const char *image, const char *name);
void *kh_resolve_rva(const char *image, size_t rva);

#define MSHookFunction kh_hook_function
#define MSFindSymbol   kh_find_symbol
```

The engine prefers PLT/GOT hooks for imported call surfaces (`kh_hook_import`):
it parses the loaded image's ELF dynamic table, finds `R_*_JUMP_SLOT`
relocations for the named symbol, and rewrites the GOT entry. No inline
prologue patch is involved. Prefer this over inline hooks whenever the target
is an import (libc, liblipc, etc.).

Inline hooks (`kh_hook_function`) use the vendored [Dobby](https://github.com/jmpews/Dobby)
engine on Kindle ARM targets. Dobby relocates ARM/Thumb-2 prologues, allocates
trampolines, and handles branch veneers and cache flushing. Host builds use a
mock backend so the ABI and registry stay testable without the cross toolchain.

`kh_hook_function_checked` performs the symbol-DB safety check before patching:
the current target bytes must match the expected prologue supplied by the caller.
This is the safer entrypoint for firmware-private RVAs resolved via
`kh_resolve_rva` (module load base from `/proc/self/maps` + recorded RVA). The
caller must describe at least an 8-byte window (`expected_len >= 8`) so the
entire region under consideration is verified before Dobby patches.

`libksubstrate-bootstrap.so` is loaded by the dynamic linker. Its constructor:

1. Checks `/mnt/us/DISABLE_KSUBSTRATE`.
2. Reads `/proc/self/comm`.
3. Scans installed tweaks for matching `.ksfilter` files.
4. `dlopen`s matching tweak libraries.
5. Fails closed per tweak without aborting the host process.

`ksubstrated` owns the hooked session:

1. Computes spawn roots from built-in UI roots plus roots named by installed
   tweak filters (each filter comm name is resolved against the system bin
   directories). Filter-derived roots that name recovery-critical processes
   (`powerd`, `sshd`, `dbus*`, OTA/storage/networking core) are refused.
2. Wraps each root with a **volatile bind mount**: the real binary is bind-mounted
   to a stable path under the session dir, then the original path is shadowed by
   a wrapper that re-execs under `LD_PRELOAD`. Nothing on the rootfs is modified;
   a reboot drops the mounts (A§14.1). The wrapped set is recorded to
   `run/wrappers.list`. If any wrap fails, every root wrapped so far is rolled
   back so a UI root is never left missing.
3. Restarts the framework into the home UI.
4. Guards against crash loops by watching UI-process health (falling edges of
   `pillow`/`appmgrd` uptime) in addition to monitor restarts; if
   `CRASH_THRESHOLD` (3) deaths land within `CRASH_WINDOW_SECS` (120s), the
   session returns to stock instead of re-arming.
5. On disable or exit, unmounts the wrappers and restarts stock UI, restoring
   exactly the roots in `run/wrappers.list`. A reboot is still clean even if the
   manifest is missing, because the mounts are volatile.

## Toolchain Relationship

The host-side `ksub` toolchain lives in the Rust workspace and produces
artifacts that match the package contract above.

Command status (this repo is an MVP; not every command is a finished pipeline):

- `ksub new tweak|library|tool` — implemented (scaffolds a project).
- `ksub build --platform kindlehf|kindlepw2` — implemented (cross-compiles).
- `ksub package` — implemented (runs the app `build.sh` scripts).
- `ksub deploy [--dest <path>]` — copies built `.kpkg` artifacts to a local or
  USB-mounted destination; for SSH transports, copy the printed artifacts with
  your own tooling.
- `ksub sym lookup|header` — implemented (parses the YAML symbol DB, emits a C
  header).
- `ksub pull`, `ksub analyze`, `ksub sym propose|promote` — **scaffolding.** They
  create working directories / template YAML and document the manual steps; they
  do not yet extract symbols from binaries.
- `ksub-logos` — **experimental.** Expands `KSYM`, `%hookf`, `%orig`, and
  `%ctor/%init`. Single-line `%hookf` signatures only; not a full Logos
  preprocessor.

The analysis pipeline is intended to compile versioned symbol databases from
exported symbols, imports, strings, Ghidra output, cross-version fingerprints, AI
proposals, and human-promoted overrides. That extraction is not yet built — the
symbol DB is authored by hand today. Runtime inline hooks must still verify
prologue signatures because firmware-specific RVAs can drift.

## Integration Plan For This Repo

1. Build `apps/com.bd452.ksubstrate` first; it stages the runtime libraries,
   daemon, CLI, and header.
2. Build `apps/com.bd452.ksubstratedemo` second; it links the demo target and
   sample tweak against the staged runtime library.
3. Run `./build.sh` or `scripts/build-in-container.sh` to refresh
   `packages/` and `manifest.json`.
4. Commit the source packages, generated `.kpkg` artifacts, `packages/`,
   and the regenerated repository manifest together.

## Recovery Ladder

1. Disable launcher: daemon unmounts wrappers and restarts stock UI, restoring
   exactly the roots recorded in `run/wrappers.list`.
2. USB sentinel: create `/mnt/us/DISABLE_KSUBSTRATE`, then reboot. The bootstrap
   checks it first and loads no tweaks.
3. Crash-loop / health guard: three UI-process deaths (or monitor restarts)
   within 120s return the session to stock automatically instead of re-arming.
4. Partial-wrap rollback: if wrapping fails midway, the daemon unmounts every
   root it already wrapped before giving up, so no UI root is left missing.
5. Hard reboot: default clean state — bind mounts are volatile, and no
   persistent global preload is armed.
